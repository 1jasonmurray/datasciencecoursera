<p align="center">Tidied UCI HAR Dataset</p>
##Introduction
The following data set was obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones  
The test and training data was combined into a single dataset.  Then only the mean and standard deviation for each measurment were filtered out.  Creating the tidyUCIdata set.  The means for each of variable was then calculated by subject and activity.  These are stored in tidyUCIdataMeans.
